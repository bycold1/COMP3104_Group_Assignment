The importance of learning DevOps engineer in software development cycle

one of the main reason why it is important is because it primarly focuses on people and not the tool.
it allows them to start working as a team workers, get them to focus on the product and services instead of worrying themselves over security and technical concerns.

DevOps practices effectively will allow for a process predicated on ease to
ship code to Production servers, apply hot-fixes, catch errors before they produce
some sort of unintended behavior and keep transparency & communication
heightened across all teams. 

Looking at the software development lifecycle
through the lens of a DevOps Engineer will produce a more informed and qualified
developer.
